Run `hatch run test:all` to run the test suite, linting, and format checking. 
Based on the results of the tests, fix any errors identified.
If formatting or linting errors are identified you may use `hatch run test:fix` to attempt to fix them automatically. Any errors which are not automatically fixed must be fixed manually. If errors must be fixed manually, first check what changes have been made with git (i.e. `git status`, `git diff...`) to see what may have changed to caused the errors. If the changes made cause test failures, review the changes and confirm if the change in functionality needs to be reflected in the test cases and update the tests accordingly. If the changes are not intended to change functionality but break the tests, let the user know before making any fixes.
