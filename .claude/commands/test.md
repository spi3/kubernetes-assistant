Run `hatch run test:all` to run the test suite, linting, and format checking. 
Based on the results of the tests, fix any errors identified.
If formatting or linting errors are identified you may use `hatch run test:fix` to attempt to fix them automatically. Any errors which are not automatically fixed must be fixed manually.
